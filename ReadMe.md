# WebExtensions History Browser [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GabLeRoux/webextensions-history-browser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GabLeRoux/webextensions-history-browser)

![webextensions-history-browser-readme](resources/webextensions-history-browser-readme.png)

A simple firefox plugin that helps you browse your history because firefox default history browser doesn't let you filter or sort based on dates as of September 2017 and other extensions that can do it aren't compatible with Firefox anymore.

## TODO

- [ ] Display history in a table
- [ ] Sort history by date
- [ ] Display number of visits per page
- [ ] Add a datetime picker range to filter by dates
- [ ] Add page title search
- [ ] Convert icon to svg (it's already a vector based icon in `resources`)

## How to build it

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The WebExtension in the [addon](addon/) folder should now work.

## TODO: Live-development

As well as watching the folder with your `manifest.json` in it, you will also have to run `webpack` in **watch mode**. You can use the [webpack-webext-plugin](https://github.com/rpl/webpack-webext-plugin) to simplify the workflow.
